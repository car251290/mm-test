 #For getting to the next View
 I will use the React Native with the moving between screens for get to a new screen.
 link I had been reading for get to the other view 
 https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigating
 
 # Fetching the data 
 I will use your method that you show me for getting the next description of ITEMS 
 A detail screen which will display the public_image, the title and the short_description.
 for get the short_description I will fetch a new item in Array and I will
  {items.map((item) => (
  //to get the description
          <Text>{item.short_description}</Text>
          //the get the title
           <Text>{item.title}</Text>
          
        ))}
        but for the image I am having problems I had been trying to get the images using the URL direct
        
        for the styles I will use a simple knowledge I got using css with the styles
